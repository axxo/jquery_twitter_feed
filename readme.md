jQuery Horizontal Twitter-Feed
=============

In the css file there are some CSS3 styles, so the scroller can be displayed slightly different on browsers that doesn't support the new CSS3 functions. The rounded corners on the scroller will not work in Internet Explorer.


Installation
-----------

    Upload the folder 'readmytweet' to your webserver
    Include jQuery from google (recommended) in the head section of your site.
    Include the 'readmytweet.js' javascript file just below the jQuery include.
    Include the 'readmytweet.css' file below the javascript.
    Make sure the images folder is in the same folder as the css file.
